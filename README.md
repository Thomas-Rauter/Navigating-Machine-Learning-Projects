Written by Thomas Rauter.

## 📘 What is this book?

Most machine learning books focus on theory, implementation, or model performance.  
This one is different.

**Decision-Making in Machine Learning Projects** is a **concise, practical guide** for navigating real ML projects — where trade-offs are constant, decisions are messy, and perfect data is rare.

This book focuses on:
- 🔍 **What** tools and techniques exist
- ⏱️ **When** to apply them
- 🧠 **Why** they help in context

You won’t find detailed math or tutorials — that’s what Google and docs are for.  
Instead, this is the resource you keep open while working, to guide real decisions.
